      <h1><em>About Devour</em></h1>
      <p>I started to write my cookbook, Devour, about 3 years ago. I've only created and documented roughly 20 recipes. Aside from that, Devour lives in a Google Doc.
        I chose this specific turkey burger recipe for a few reasons.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>It's the best burger without a bun I've ever had.</li>
          <li>It's a healthy but delicious meal.</li>
          <li>Who doesn't love quacamole?</li>
          </ol>
      <p>I've made this burger for people with all different types of eating habits, and have successfully pleased them all.
        Even a non-guac eater enjoyed it!
