1. *Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?*

Learning HTML was 100% new to me. The only time I did any sort of web design was with Wordpress with no coding. It has been very interesting! There were some challenges, but I was able to do what was required.

2. *Next module we continue with CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?*

I am very excited to learn more about CSS. I am also very anxious because I feel like I still do not have a strong understanding of HTML. I felt confident up until this week and now I may have things confused. I am going to spend time going back through the past couple of weeks and make sure I fully understand. I think what is challenging me so much is that there seems to be so many ways to do one thing. When I am comparing the website, W3 schools and other resources, they all show slightly different ways to achieve the same thing. For instance, a problem I had this module was that codepen showed an example of nav using href="./index.html". That wouldn't work for me, so after some research I did it without "./" and it worked. Should I have known not to use "./"? 

3. *Free Response: Summarize your challenges and successes.  What did you do to overcome your challenges?*

This was the hardest module for me. When I first loaded my page, it looked crazy! I spent hours trying to fix the formatting. I am not happy with the way my pages turned out.
My biggest issues were:

-Centering lists within divs. I could center align the text but the bullets stayed to the left.

-Div styling. I had a lot of trouble with using different styles in the head. When I added padding to the head, it made each div one large section. I tried adding breaks and adjusting the padding. The only way I could keep the divs separate was to add the style to the element itself.

-Text and image format. I could not get "float" to work the way I needed it to. I did finally get text next to pictures, but then I could not center the text inline with the pictures.
