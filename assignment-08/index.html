    <h1>Ellie's Favorite Song</h1>
    <h2>The Police: Every Breath You Take</h2>

    <div id="intro" class="container">
      <p>I chose this song because my Dad used to sing this to me all the time. Up until about 2 years ago, I had no idea that it wasn't a love song. Sting wrote this song about his obsessive lost lover with Big Brother- surveillance and control in mind. This was also in the 80's....I wonder what he thinks about Cookies. (not the kind you eat) So, just in case you thought it was a love song too, I thought I'd share.</p>

      <h3>Lyrics: Comical translation of Every Breath You Take</h3>

      <p>Every breath you take (breath analyzer) and every move you make (motion detector)<br />
        Every bond you break (polygraph), every step you take (electronic anklet), I'll be watching you (video surveillance)<br />
        Every single day (continuous monitoring) and every word you (bugs, wiretaps, mikes)<br />
        Every game you play, every night you stay (light amplifier), I'll be watching you<br />

      Oh, can't you see you belong to me<br />
      How my poor heart aches with every step you take<br />

      Every move you make, and every vow you break (voice stress analysis)<br />
      Every smile you fake (brain wave analysis), every claim you stake (computer matching), I'll be watching you<br />

      Since you've gone I've been lost without a trace<br />
      I dream at night, I can only see your face<br />
      I look around but it's you I can't replace<br />
      I feel so cold and I long for your embrace<br />
      I keep crying, "Baby, baby, please"<br />

      Oh, can't you see you belong to me<br />
      How my poor heart aches with every step you take<br />

      Every move you make and every vow you break<br />
      Every smile you fake, every claim you stake, I'll be watching you<br />
      Every move you make, every step you take, I'll be watching you<br />

      I'll be watching you<br />
      Every breath you take and every move you make<br />
      Every bond you break, every step you take (I'll be watching you)<br />
      Every single day, every word you say<br />
      Every game you play, every night you stay (I'll be watching you)<br />
      Every move you make, every vow you break<br />
      Every smile you fake, every claim you stake (I'll be watching you)<br />
      Every single day, every word you say<br />
      Every game you play, every night you stay (I'll be watching you)<br />
      Every breath you take, every move you make<br />
      Every bond you break, every step you take (I'll be watching you)<br />
      Every single day, every word you say<br />
      Every game you play, every night you stay (I'll be watching you)<br />
      Every move you make, every vow you break<br />
      Every smile you fake, every claim you stake (I'll be watching you)<br />
      Every single day, every word you say<br />
      Every game you play, every night you stay (I'll be watching you)<br /></p>
