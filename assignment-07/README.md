1. *Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do they serve?*

I come across forms everyday. Almost every ad I am served includes a form. Usually they are text entries asking for an email address, name and phone number. There are also forms anytime I visit a site to login with text entries for my username and a password input.
2. *List examples of a text, selection, and button input, and their usage*

  **Text**: Examples of text inputs are text boxes on email sign up for first name, last name, birthday, phone number. They are used so users can type information that is available to the browser. The text area input allows users to leave comments or concerns. These are frequently used for reviews.

  **Selection**: Examples of selection inputs can be seen on travel sites like Expedia. Radio buttons or checkbox elements are there for users to filter options such a specific airlines, flight times, number of stops, etc. Checkboxes and dropdown selections are also frequently used on shopping sites for users to filter their searches. Selection inputs help users know what their options are and narrow them down as needed.

  **Button**: Examples of button inputs are used on almost every site. It is an interactive element that allows fields and links to function. Most sites have a search bar (text input) that has a button input of either a magnifying glass, the words "go", "search", "done", etc. The upload button input is used on Moodle to submit assignments. The submit button element is used on sites when subscribing and on Moodle after uploading the file.

3. *Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.*

Learning about images, tables are forms was so interesting! I feel that it allowed me to see the "big picture" and better understand how sites function. I was able to almost fully create my index.html page from memory. I pulled up my index.html from assignment 6 to reference while I was working.
I did get confused while learning about the submit button. On the course site it states that this is the only input that does not require a name attribute. On the W3schools site it shows an example of where the name attribute is not used and states that it will not submit the value of that field.
