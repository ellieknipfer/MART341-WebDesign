1. *Who was your imaginary client? How did they describe their site needs?*

My friend Shenna. We just discussed seeing a page with site navigation and some content. For the final, I plan to use the logo and info we are working on now.

2. *Why is it important to consider a mobile-first design?*

Mobile-first is important to ensure you deliver the right user experience to the right screen. Mobile screens have limited space, so you want to make sure the content is available on mobile screens. Most people use their mobile phones most frequently, so if they are shopping or looking for information, the website should display properly on the mobile screen.


3. *Free Response: Please discuss your challenges and how you overcame them.*

I tried to learn more about different layouts. My plan is to use that information in the final project with a grid layout that looks more like a "real site". For this site, I did not have any specific challenges.
