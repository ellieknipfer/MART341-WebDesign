1. *What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font?*
System fonts are installed on ones local device and system. They are available to developers and most programs, but not always to the web. Web fonts are custom and hosted on a server. To appear, they do not have to be available on the user's device, but do require some elements to be called up correctly. Web-safe fonts are available by the system. Such as Arial, Georgia, or Times new roman.

2. *What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?*
If the primary font listed is not available, the fallback or font stack allows the browser to try to load those incase the primary font fails to load. It is important to also not have unrelated fonts as a primary and fallback because of how it will appear to the user.

3. *Free Response: Please discuss any challenges you had this week and what you did to overcome them.*
I really enjoyed this weeks lesson. I did not have any specific challenges. I was surprised at how everything worked out smoothly!
