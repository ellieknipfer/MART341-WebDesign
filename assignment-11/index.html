    <div class="opening-paragraph">
      To be the best, whether in sports or business or any other aspect of
      life, it’s never enough to just get to the top; you have to stay there,
      and then you have to climb higher, because there’s always someone
      right behind you trying to catch up. Most people are willing to settle for “good enough.”
      But if you want to be unstoppable, those words
      mean nothing to you. Being the best means engineering your life so
      you never stop until you get what you want, and then you keep going
      until you get what’s next. And then you go for even more.

     If that describes you, this book is your life story. You’re what I call
     a Cleaner, the most intense and driven competitor imaginable. You
     refuse limitations. You quietly and forcefully do whatever it takes to
     get what you want. You understand the insatiable addiction to
     success; it defines your entire life.
    </div>
    <div class="third-paragraph">
     If that doesn’t describe you yet, congratulations: you are on a lifechanging
     journey to discover the power you already possess.
     This isn’t about motivation. If you’re reading this book, you’re
     already motivated. Now you have to turn that into action and results.
     You can read clever motivational slogans all day and still have no
     idea how to get where you want to be. Wanting something won’t get
     you anywhere. Trying to be someone you’re not won’t get you
     anywhere. Waiting for someone or something to light your fire won’t
     get you anywhere.
    </div>
    <div class="third-paragraph">
     So how are you going to get there?
     Believe this: Everything you need to be great is already inside you.
     All your ambitions and secrets, your darkest dreams . . . they’re
     waiting for you to just let go.
