**How will VCS benefit you?** VCS allows developers/writers to track changes over time. If the changes do not work or need to be corrected, VCS allows you to revert back without filling directories with new "save as" files. VCS allows all parties to easily share and collaborate files to see all changes and manage issues. In this class specifically, we can track changes on our weekly assignments, test things and revert back if needed. Our git repositories offer free hosted webspace and cloud backup. Lastly, GitHub is a standard tool in the industy and will prepare us for work in the future.
