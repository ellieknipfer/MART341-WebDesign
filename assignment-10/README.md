1. *Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?*

Universal: used to style every element on a page indicated with (*).

Element: used to select elements of a certain type.

Class: the class names in HTML are used to style elements with (.) in front of the class name.

ID: the id in HTML are used to style elements with (#) in front of the id.

The type of selector is chosen based off how much information is on a page. A page with fewer elements would benefit from a universal selector type. The class and id would be used to add specific styling to related elements or sections. This allows for greater flexibility.

2. *Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, RGB values, or hex codes.*

I chose a color palette that reflected the color palette of the 1930s. I chose dark salmon, artichoke green (#4B6F44), white and black. I tried a few other colors using their names, but ended up not liking how it looked.

3. *Free Response: Please discuss any challenges you had this week and how you overcame them.*

This was the first time I looked at your example, so I did not really have any challenges. The biggest challenge was deciding how I wanted to site to look with all the new options! I changed the coloring, font, border and layout at least ten times.
