# MART341-WebDesign-ellieknipfer
This week I learned the purpose of files and directories, to include the different types and how they are fundamental to web development. With the knowledge of Markdown language, naming practices, and directory structure, we learned how to create a new repository in GitHub. As GitHub is completley new to me, I used YouTube videos and other resources to help me through the process. After reviewing the material a few times and following the steps provided on Moodle, I *believe* I successfully completed creating a new repository and answering the prompts. I am not able to use Markdown in the response.txt. I tried deleting everything and starting new and using the text editor application on my mac. The changes I tried to make will not appear. I am going to continue to figure how to fix that.
