1. *Did you learn anything new about web development (i.e., using GitHub, version control, repositories)?*

Everything I learned was new! I have never developed a site before or used Github/Atom.

2. *Did you learn anything new about web design (i.e., using media, color, fonts)?*

Again, this was my first time doing anything with web design. I really enjoyed learning how to use media, color, and fonts. There are so many options! It's really interesting all the things you can do.

3. *Free Response: Discuss any challenges you had and what you did to overcome them.*

There were many times I tried to incorporate something new like a grid or flex layout. I used the resources provided from class and other sites. I was never able to use them, but each time I tried, I learned something new. The way I overcame most challenges was simply having the webpage and Atom up and refreshing after each change until it was correct.
